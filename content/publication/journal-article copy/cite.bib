	abstract = {Due to its advantages in participation and collaboration, participatory geo-analysis has been used for solving different types of geographical issues. Participatory geo-analysis is usually a complicated process consisting of various tasks that may involve different multidisciplinary participants. Previous studies have focused primarily on how to improve participation in specific individual tasks, especially idea discussion and decision-making, but they have ignored collaboration throughout the entire process. During a complete participatory geo-analysis effort, the various participants should con­ centrate on their familiar work and fully exploit their talents to perform work collaboratively. Therefore, we propose an activity-based process construction method to assist different participants in understanding the geo-analysis process and in concentrating on their familiar work. Eight core activities are established for the geo-analysis process: (1) context definition and resource collection, (2) data processing, (3) data analysis, (4) data visualization, (5) geo-analysis model construction, (6) model effectiveness evaluation, (7) geographical simulation, and (8) decision making. By using a visualization-based method, different activities can be linked together to represent the entire analytical process. Moreover, each activity is designed via a specialized web-based workspace in which online tools and resources are accessed to assist the participants with their geo-analysis practices. A prototype system was developed based on the proposed method, and a case study on a participatory risk assessment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was demonstrated using this system. The result suggests that the proposed method can promote collaboration among partici­ pants with different backgrounds, and verifies its feasibility and suitability.},

	abstract = {In the context of the continuous development of urbanization and global climate change, urban flooding risk has become a wellpublicized research issue. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) performs very well in urban rain-runoff simulations and is widely used to build flood models in specific areas. Because of the complicated and tedious processing work for urban flood modeling and simulation, multifield participants’ cooperation is becoming a trend. To promote the research and application of flood modeling and simulation, some resource sharing-oriented systems and platforms have been proposed with the advantages of network technology. However, they still require a participatory environment that can help modeling participants overcome the difficulties of distributed cooperation in the process of SWMM-based flood modeling and simulation. Therefore, we designed and implemented an online participatory system to coordinate the effective collaboration of modeling participants in this process. By referring to the scenarios and specific participatory demands in the modeling process, the system provides a guiding framework that consists of multiple participatory activities and prepares a series of online auxiliary tools designed for these activities. Using the main urban area of Lishui City as the study area, it was confirmed that the process of SWMM-based flood modeling and simulation can be demonstrated collaboratively on the online participatory system developed in this study.},

	abstract = {Collaborative geographic analysis can lead to better outcomes but requires complicated interac­ tions among participants, support resources and analytic tools. A process expression with explicit structure and content can help coordinate and guide these interactions. For different geographic problems, the structure and content of collaborative geographic analysis are generally distinct. Since the process structure embodies the pathway of problem-solving and the process content contains the information flow and internal interactions, both the structure and the content of the process expression must be clarified during process customization. However, relevant studies concerning the collaborative geographic analysis process mainly focus on the process structure, which remains a “black box” in terms of the process content, especially the internal interactions. Therefore, this article designs a customizable process expression model that takes both process structure and content into account and proposes a corresponding process customization method for collaborative geographic analysis. Additionally, a support method for geographic analysis process implementation is also provided. To verify the feasibility and capability, these methods were implemented in a prototype system, and a case study on traffic noise assessment was conducted. The results suggest that the proposed strategy can effectively improve geographic analysis by customizing processes, guiding participants, performing interactions, and recording operations throughout the process.},

	abstract = {Earth system modelling (ESM) is essential for understanding past, present and future Earth processes. Deep learning (DL), with the data-driven strength of neural networks, has promise for improving ESM by exploiting information from Big Data. Yet existing hybrid ESMs largely have deep neural networks incorporated only during the initial stage of model development. In this Perspective, we examine progress in hybrid ESM, focusing on the Earth surface system, and propose a framework that integrates neural networks into ESM throughout the modelling lifecycle. In this framework, DL computing systems and ESM-related knowledge repositories are set up in a homogeneous computational environment. DL can infer unknown or missing information, feeding it back into the knowledge repositories, while the ESM-related knowledge can constrain inference results of the DL. By fostering collaboration between ESM-related knowledge and DL systems, adaptive guidance plans can be generated through question-answering mechanisms and recommendation functions. As users interact iteratively, the hybrid system deepens its understanding of their preferences, resulting in increasingly customized, scalable and accurate guidance plans for modelling Earth processes. The advancement of this framework necessitates interdisciplinary collaboration, focusing on explainable DL and maintaining observational data to ensure the reliability of simulations.},

	abstract = {Geo-simulation experiments (GSEs) are experiments allowing the simulation and exploration of Earth’s surface (such as hydrological, geomorphological, atmospheric, biological, and social processes and their interactions) with the usage of geo-analysis models (hereafter called ‘models’). Computational processes represent the steps in GSEs where researchers employ these models to analyze data by computer, encompassing a suite of actions carried out by researchers. These processes form the crux of GSEs, as GSEs are ultimately implemented through the execution of computational processes. Recent advancements in computer technology have facilitated sharing models online to promote resource accessibility and environmental dependency rebuilding, the lack of which are two fundamental barriers to reproduction. In particular, the trend of encapsulating models as web services online is gaining traction. While such service-oriented strategies aid in the reproduction of computational processes, they often ignore the association and interaction among researchers’ actions regarding the usage of sequential resources (model-service resources and data resources); documenting these actions can help clarify the exact order and details of resource usage. Inspired by these strategies, this study explores the organization of computational processes, which can be extracted with a collection of action nodes and related logical links (nodelink ensembles). The action nodes are the abstraction of the interactions between participant entities and resource elements (i.e., model-service resource elements and data resource elements), while logical links represent the logical relationships between action nodes. In addition, the representation of actions, the formation of documentation, and the reimplementation of documentation are interconnected stages in this approach. Specifically, the accurate representation of actions facilitates the correct performance of these actions; therefore, the operation of actions can be documented in a standard way, which is crucial for the successful reproduction of computational processes based on standardized documentation. A prototype system is designed to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed approach. By employing this pragmatic approach, researchers can share their computational processes in a structured and open format, allowing peer scientists to re-execute op­ erations with initial resources and reimplement the initial computational processes of GSEs via the open web.},

	abstract = {With the development of interregional trade, a potential disaster that happens in one place could cause enormous economic losses in distant areas. Timely and comprehensive post-disaster assessments play a significant role in guiding disaster recovery, and for reconstruction and planning for future disaster risk reduction. In this study, we evaluate the post-disaster economic impacts due to Sichuan earthquake in 2008 and its regional and industrial spillover effects based on a Chinese multi-regional input–output table. The results show that the 2008 Sichuan earthquake caused around 1725 billion US dollars of value-added losses and 69.9 million people of employment losses. The Chemical industry in Guangdong and Zhejiang suffered severe value-added losses due to indirect effects through supply chains. Furthermore, public administration in Henan, Sichuan, and Guangdong suffered large employment losses. In general, we find that the economically less developed provinces are more susceptible to larger losses compared to the economically developed provinces. The results in this study can provide information for decision-makers to devise effective solutions on how to release relief funds and for dividing adaptation plans to avoid serious economic losses due to future disasters.},

The results show that Hong Kong SAR has been a net CO2 importer and Mainland China plays a dominating role in the embodied CO2 emissions of Hong Kong SAR. The sectors with high imported CO2 emissions are mainly the energy sectors, such as electricity, heat, gas and water production and supply. Population density, GDP per capita, and trade openness have significantly positive effects on net CO2 emissions increases in Hong Kong SAR, with population density taking the leading role. Population density increases by 1\%, total net CO2 emissions increase by 4\%. Population slowdown scenario simulation results show that net CO2 emissions of Hong Kong SAR could be reduced by 5.5\%. Whereas, net CO2 emissions of Hong Kong SAR could increase by 8.7\% in the accelerated economic development scenario. Therefore, to reduce CO2 emissions, Hong Kong SAR need control its population, develop the circular economy, and promote green lifestyle and consumption patterns.},
