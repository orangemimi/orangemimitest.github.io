## About Me

Zhiyi Zhu is a Ph.D candidate of open science at the open geographic modeling and simulation lab (OpenGMS). Her interest lies in Geo-Informatics, encompassing three interconnected fields: Reproducibility, Geostatistics, and Geographical Modeling and Simulation. Over the last few years, she have refined and enriched the concept of reproducibility in geo-simulation experiments (GSEs) to address scientific challenges. This includes enhancing information sharing among researchers to promote research's reproducibility, evaluating reproducibility using both qualitative index analysis and quantitative statistical methods to increase the reliability of GSEs, and creating practical tools that allow scholars to investigate domain knowledge in GeoScience, building on the specific expertise of previous research.
